# LifeManagementAssistant

# Project Abstract
This software applications will mainly be used to assist people with their everyday life. This can consist of helping them make a schedule, budgeting money, keeping track of tasks and their progress towards those tasks, ultimately anything that can keep peoples lives organized and less overwhelming. This software will also be able to set reminders for the individual with certain levels of priorities that the user may choose. Similarly, each task may be able to be broken up into subtasks and each subtask given a specific value that once completed fulfills that amount of progress toward the task. All that the user will have to do is keep the application updated with what has been completed, spent, or tasks/events coming up and it will store that in a database for future reference.

# Project Relevance
This proposal will have educational goals such as involving unit testing, exposure to new libraries or libraries not often used, version control, object-oriented programming, and it will be test driven. This proposal will also test our minds and creativity by presenting a real life scenarios that must have implementations that are practical, assessable, and easy to use; otherwise it may be too much of a hassle keeping everything up to date.

# Conceptual Design
This software will use the language(s) Java and maybe SQL or JavaScript. It will have a database which it stores all the information that its user inputs. Whether that be regarding tasks, scheduling, budgeting, health/diet, etcetera. What I hope to bring to this application is being able to aid in the design and implementations of all the tasks that it can help manage. I also can help with the creation of the database where it stores all the userâ€™s future and potentially past data. I foresee myself being able to help with almost any part of this project and feel confident in my abilities to do so. The only limitations that I would say I have currently is making it more assessable using things such as a mobile application or something with a user interface.
